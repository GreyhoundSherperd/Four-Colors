# Four-Colors
This project is a text-based strategic game called Four Colors.

Each player gets 20 cards of 4 colors, each color has a different objective:
- Red: Attack, 1 red card dealt 1 damage if unblocked or countered, play in a zigzag pattern with green cards to multi-combo,
for example "Red Green Red". In a combo, there is always 1 more red card than blue cards.
- Blue: Block, 1 blue card defends 1 damage, can multi-block without green cards.
- Green: Bridge, Green cards were played in a zigzag pattern with red or yellow cards to multi-combo or multi-counter.
- Yellow: Counter, A yellow card is a hybrid of red and blue, a yellow card blocks 1 damage and deal 1 damage, can multi-counter with green cards.
Can only play if a red card was played last turn, and can only play equal or less than the red cards 
played.
